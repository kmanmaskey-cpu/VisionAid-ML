# VisionAid-ML: Spatial Awareness for the Visually Impaired

The end goal of this 9-month project is to develop a **Sixth Sense Detector**—a seamless integration of AI and human 
perception that allows users to feel the layout of a room through spatial audio and haptic cues.\

Features :
Real-time Processing
Smart Feedback:Auditory alerts (1000Hz) trigger only when the center path is obstructed.
Dynamic Normalization: min-max normalizaiton is applied here due to which it adjusts with different lighting automatically.

Roadmap
Month 2-3:Optical Flow & Time-to-Contact (Depth Perception).
Month 4-5:YOLOv8 Object Recognition (Identifying *what* is in the way).
Month 6-9:Spatial Audio Integration (Stereo-directional beeps).

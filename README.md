#PROBLEM : Many CBSE students every year suffer from the fear of failing , not doing good enough or academic pressure in general this is primarily
due to them not knowing where to start  and where to find resources which can gurantee a dramatic improvment in academic level outside of schools.

#GOAL: Knowing these problem my goal is to build an ai which can give questions tailored for that specific student by using the large amount of data which are availaible in the internet.
This will be able to save the student from uneccesarily finding all of the past PYQ(past question paper) of board exams(especially the pre boards) and wasitng time.

#FEATURES:
REGEX Parsing ,JSON Export,quiz

#SYSTEM:
automated exctraction from pyq
python based quiz which extracts the level of the specific student
using personal performance data to recommend specific questions on the weka areas of the student
